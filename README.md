# üì¶ Operational Data Analysis & Dashboard üìä

üìÇ Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing data for Elin Electronics, a leading logistics and supply chain company. The dataset encompasses various shipment aspects, including payment statuses, delivery times, employee efficiency, and shipment costs. The goal is to gain actionable insights to streamline operations and improve decision-making processes. An interactive Excel dashboard was developed to provide a user-friendly visualization of these insights, enabling better monitoring and optimization of shipment-related operations.

üîë Key Insights:

‚Ä¢ Payment and Delivery Analysis: Explores the relationship between payment statuses (such as paid, pending, or refunded) and shipment delivery times, allowing for a deeper understanding of how payment issues may influence delivery performance.

‚Ä¢ Customer Segmentation: Categorizes and identifies the impact of different customer types (e.g., regular, premium) on the shipment process, including delivery speed, costs, and satisfaction levels.

‚Ä¢ Cost Analysis: Analyzes trends in shipment charges, identifies the most costly shipment categories, and recommends areas for potential cost-cutting measures to improve profitability.

üìä Interactive Dashboard:

The project includes the creation of an interactive Excel dashboard, which allows stakeholders to explore the data in a dynamic and intuitive manner. Key features of the dashboard include:

‚Ä¢ Track Shipment Status: A visual representation of the current and past shipment statuses that provides insights into timely deliveries and delayed shipments.

‚Ä¢ Analyze Payment and Delivery: Interactive filters to explore how different payment modes (credit, cash on delivery, online) correlate with delivery performance, enabling operational adjustments based on payment-related delays.

‚Ä¢ Measure Employee Performance: Visualizations that help evaluate employee performance based on the efficiency of shipment handling, tracking how delivery times and error rates vary over time.

‚Ä¢ Identify High-Cost Shipments: Identification of costly shipments by category, helping management pinpoint high-expense areas and optimize routes and delivery methods.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Excel Functions Used:

To derive insights and create the dashboard, several advanced Excel techniques were utilized:

‚Ä¢ VLOOKUP: A critical function for matching and retrieving data from different datasets (e.g., payment, shipment, and customer data) for seamless analysis and accurate reporting.

‚Ä¢ Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts: Powerful tools used for summarizing large datasets, enabling the identification of trends, patterns, and insights related to shipment status, payment patterns, employee efficiency, and costs.

‚Ä¢ Conditional Formatting: Applied to highlight key data points such as delayed shipments, shipments with high costs, or underperforming employees, making critical data easily accessible and actionable.

‚Ä¢ Complex Functions: Functions such as IF, SUMIF, COUNTIF, and custom formulas were used to filter data, calculate efficiency ratios, aggregate shipment costs, and perform advanced segmentation and categorization.
